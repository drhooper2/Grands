                <h2>Benny and Porter in the Snow!</h2>
                <p>I have been truly blessed. Maybe I need to add more text. Today we played out in the snow, and the boys each made a snowman. Ports' snowman was like <span class="highlight"> Olof from Frozen</span> because he had legs. Benny put lots of thought and detail into his snowman, including rock eyes, an icicle nose, my eag bags for the sides of his head, and a hat and scarf.</p>
                <p>When we finished building the snowmen, we had a snowball fight. Of course I won. But they did gang up on me.<br>After the snowball fight, we had hot chocolate and whipping cream.</p><p>It was great to get outside for a while today, the boys needed it, and so did I.</p>
